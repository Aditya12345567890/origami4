<h2> Panda </h2> 
<p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Pandas are BIG eaters – every day they fill their tummies for up to 12
            hours, shifting up to 12 kilograms of bamboo!
          </li>
          <li>
            The giant panda’s scientific name is Ailuropoda melanoleuca, which means
            “black and white cat-foot”.
          </li>
          <li>
            Baby pandas are born pink and measure about 15cm – that’s about the size
            of a pencil! They are also born blind and only open their eyes six to
            eight weeks after birth.

<h2>Teddy bear</h2>
<p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Teddy bears got their name from the story that Teddy Roosevelt refused
            to shoot a bear cub while on a hunting trip in 1902.
          </li>
          <li>
            The first toy stuffed bear was created by German toymaker Margarete
            Steiff. She created a soft plush with movable arms and legs and a
            friendly face after taking her nephew to the zoo in 1903.
          </li>
          <li>
            Washable teddy bears didn't appear until 1954 when the stuffing was
            switched to an easier to clean nylon fill. Before that, they were
            stuffed with mohair,
